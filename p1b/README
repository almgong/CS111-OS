Got help from the linked socket programming page in spec and used the example in
the mcrypt(3) documentation as a starting point for encryption/decryption.

This lab contains:

	client.c - the client program that will connect to a specified port
	and optionally log + encrypt/decrypt.

	server.c - the complementary server program that will accept a connection
	from the client and relay the i/o from a shell process.

	my.key - a key used for encryption/decryption.

	README - this file.

	Makefile - exposes clean, client, server, and dist. An all option is provided
	but not needed per spec.
